Are you sometimes struggling with the clutter of your sidebar?
A click on this simple button shows an empty sidebar whenever you need tidiness.

This extension creates free space in your editor in a simple way without ruining your layout or further setting modifications.
An empty sidebar puts your focus on the main content of the editor and, with that, helps you to increase your productivity.


## Settings and Commands

None. This extension is just an empty sidebar without any further functionality.
